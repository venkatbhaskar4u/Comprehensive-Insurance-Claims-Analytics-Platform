# Insurance Claims Data Analytics: Simulation & Educational Workflow

## Overview
This project is a **basic simulation and conceptual demonstration** of how insurance claims data can be modeled, analyzed, and reported using SQL and Python. Designed primarily for students, newcomers, and those curious about real-world data analyst workflows, it offers an approachable introduction to large-scale insurance analytics environments.

## Purpose
The schema and code are created to **explain data pipeline fundamentals**, business logic, and analytic reporting in a hands-on, accessible way—**not for production use**. The project focuses on clarity, modular structure, and step-by-step process visualization, mirroring what enterprise-scale analytics typically involve.

## What You Will Learn
- How data tables relate in a multi-entity insurance setting (customers, agents, policies, claims)
- Basics of SQL querying, data transformation, aggregations, ranking, and reporting
- Simple optimization strategies (indexing, modular queries, views)
- Foundations for building more advanced analytics, dashboards, and automated reporting

## Workflow Highlights
- **Table Setup:** Relational schema simulates a realistic insurance business.
- **Querying:** Examples of everyday reporting and business intelligence use cases.
- **Transformation:** Demonstrates enrichment and classification in SQL.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Aggregations, window functions, and cohort analysis.
- **Optimization:** Indexes and efficient subqueries for scalable analysis.
- **View Creation:** Modular business reports, easy to adapt for dashboards.

## Intended Audience
- **Students, Interns, and Entry-Level Analysts:** Learn through direct experimentation.
- **Educators:** Use as a teaching resource for database, SQL, and analytics fundamentals.
- **Self-Learners:** Explore project-based development in data analysis/op/research settings.

## How To Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the schema in SQLite (or PostgreSQL).
3. Run the Python data loader for sample content.
4. Use the SQL and Python analytics scripts for reporting and visualization.
