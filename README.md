# Comprehensive Insurance Claims Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world insurance environment, including relational database design, advanced SQL queries, Python analysis/reporting, and dashboarding. Key workflows reflect the depth expected from a senior analyst: data modeling, ETL, KPI generation, time series cohorting, fraud flags, and business data storytelling.

## Key Features
- **Relational Database Modeling:** Multi-table design (customers, policies, claims, agents, payouts) in PostgreSQL/SQLite.
- **SQL ETL & Data Quality:** Robust scripts for table creation, ingestion, joins, data cleaning, and constraint enforcement.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Implements window functions, subqueries, CTEs, cohort analysis, and calculated KPIs in SQL.
- **Integration with Python:** Uses Pandas/SQLAlchemy for reporting, trend analysis, and exporting to business formats.
- **Visualization:** Automated visual dashboards for trends, KPIs, fraud stats, and operational reporting.
- **Business Use Cases:** Includes performance reporting, risk scoring, and claims fraud detection flags.

## Tools
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for demo)
- Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository & install dependencies.
2. Run the database setup script to create and populate the database.
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook for analytics and reporting or use the Streamlit dashboard.
